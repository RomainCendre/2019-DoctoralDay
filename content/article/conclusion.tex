\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this study, we evaluated the pertinence of three extraction methods on \ac{rcm} images, for diagnosis of Lentigo. Haralick and Deep Learning approaches seem suitable for classification along three categories and some improvements could be added to Deep Learning extraction method. Some improvements can be added for Deep Learning method. Instead of using a simple Transfer Learning, we can use a fine-tuning solution by training some of the last layers to fit dataset.\par
However, should be noted that this study realize classification on sub-parts of our original images and next work should apply on them. This could be done using a patch approach method, making classification on sub-part of images or using Deep Learning end to end solution.\par
